# The Galactic Garden: A Celestial Ecosystem Simulator!

This is an interactive simulation where you can cultivate your own cosmic ecosystem. 
Attract particles to form stars, watch them grow into supernovas and black holes, and even name your own constellations!

# How to Play
Move your mouse around to attract tiny particles.
Particles merge to gain mass, and when the mass is large enough, it will form a star.
Stars can continue to grow, eventually turning into supernovas and collapsing into black holes. Black holes will suck up nearby stars and particles, so be careful!
Create 3 or more stars to form a constellation, and give it a name!
